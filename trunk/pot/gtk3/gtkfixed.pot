"For most applications, you should not use this container! It keeps you from "
"having to learn about the other GTK+ containers, but it results in broken "
"applications.  With #GtkFixed, the following things will result in truncated "
"text, overlapping widgets, and other display bugs: <itemizedlist> "
"<listitem><para> Themes, which may change widget sizes. </para></listitem> "
"<listitem><para> Fonts other than the one you used to write the app will of "
"course change the size of widgets containing text; keep in mind that users "
"may use a larger font because of difficulty reading the default, or they may "
"be using Windows or the framebuffer port of GTK+, where different fonts are "
"available. </para></listitem> <listitem><para> Translation of text into "
"other languages changes its size. Also, display of non-English text will use "
"a different font in many cases. </para></listitem> </itemizedlist>"

"In addition, the fixed widget can't properly be mirrored in right-to-left "
"languages such as Hebrew and Arabic. i.e. normally GTK+ will flip the "
"interface to put labels to the right of the thing they label, but it can't "
"do that with #GtkFixed. So your application will not be usable in right-to-"
"left languages."

"Finally, fixed positioning makes it kind of annoying to add/remove GUI "
"elements, since you have to reposition all the other elements. This is a "
