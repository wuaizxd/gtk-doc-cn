"This function works for file descriptors as returned by the open(), creat(), "
"pipe() and fileno() calls in the Microsoft C runtime. In order to "
"meaningfully use this function your code should use the same C runtime as "
"GLib uses, which is msvcrt.dll. Note that in current Microsoft compilers it "
"is near impossible to convince it to build code that would use msvcrt.dll. "
"The last Microsoft compiler version that supported using msvcrt.dll as the C "
"runtime was version 6. The GNU compiler and toolchain for Windows, also "
"known as Mingw, fully supports msvcrt.dll."

"If you have created a #GIOChannel for a file descriptor and started watching "
"(polling) it, you shouldn't call read() on the file descriptor. This is "
"because adding polling for a file descriptor is implemented in GLib on "
"Windows by starting a thread that sits blocked in a read() from the file "
"descriptor most of the time. All reads from the file descriptor should be "
"done by this internal GLib thread. Your code should call only "
"g_io_channel_read()."
