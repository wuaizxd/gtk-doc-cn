"The lifecycle of an iterator can be a little confusing at first. Iterators "
"are expected to always be valid for as long as the model is unchanged (and "
"doesn't emit a signal). The model is considered to own all outstanding "
"iterators and nothing needs to be done to free them from the user's point of "
"view. Additionally, some models guarantee that an iterator is valid for as "
"long as the node it refers to is valid (most notably the #GtkTreeStore and "
"#GtkListStore). Although generally uninteresting, as one always has to allow "
"for the case where iterators do not persist beyond a signal, some very "
"important performance enhancements were made in the sort model. As a result, "
"the #GTK_TREE_MODEL_ITERS_PERSIST flag was added to indicate this behavior."
