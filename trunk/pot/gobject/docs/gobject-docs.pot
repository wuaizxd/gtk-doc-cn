"Most modern programming languages come with their own native object systems "
"and additional fundamental algorithmic language constructs. Just as GLib "
"serves as an implementation of such fundamental types and algorithms (linked "
"lists, hash tables and so forth), the GLib Object System provides the "
"required implementations of a flexible extensible and intentionally easy to "
"map (into other languages) object-oriented framework for C. The substantial "
