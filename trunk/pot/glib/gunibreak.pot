"Determines the break type of @c. @c should be a Unicode character (to derive "
"a character from UTF-8 encoded text, use g_utf8_get_char()). The break type "
"is used to find word and line breaks (\"text boundaries\"), Pango implements "
"the Unicode boundary resolution algorithms and normally you would use a "
"function such as pango_break() instead of caring about break types yourself."
