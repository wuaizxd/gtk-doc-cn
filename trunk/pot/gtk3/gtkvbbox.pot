"A button box should be used to provide a consistent layout of buttons "
"throughout your application. The layout/spacing can be altered by the "
"programmer, or if desired, by the user to alter the 'feel' of a program to a "
"small degree."

"A #GtkVButtonBox is created with gtk_vbutton_box_new(). Buttons are packed "
"into a button box the same way widgets are added to any other container, "
"using gtk_container_add(). You can also use gtk_box_pack_start() or "
"gtk_box_pack_end(), but for button boxes both these functions work just like "
"gtk_container_add(), ie., they pack the button in a way that depends on the "
"current layout style and on whether the button has had "
"gtk_button_box_set_child_secondary() called on it."
