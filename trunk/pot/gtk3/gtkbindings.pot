"The above example will not have the desired effect of causing \"&lt;"
"Control&gt;Right\" and \"&lt;Control&gt;Left\" key presses to be ignored by "
"GTK+. Instead, it just causes any existing bindings from the bindings set "
"\"MoveCursor3\" to be deleted, so when \"&lt;Control&gt;Right\" or \"&lt;"
"Control&gt;Left\" are pressed, no binding for these keys is found in binding "
"set \"MoveCursor3\". GTK+ will thus continue to search for matching key "
"bindings, and will eventually lookup and find the default GTK+ bindings for "
"entries which implement word movement. To keep GTK+ from activating its "
"default bindings, the \"unbind\" keyword can be used like this:"

"Now, GTK+ will find a match when looking up \"&lt;Control&gt;Right\" and "
"\"&lt;Control&gt;Left\" key presses before it resorts to its default "
"bindings, and the match instructs it to abort (\"unbind\") the search, so "
"the key presses are not consumed by this widget. As usual, further "
"processing of the key presses, e.g. by an entry's parent widget, is now "
"possible. </para> </refsect2>"
