"Sets the priority of a #GtkTextTag. Valid priorities are start at 0 and go "
"to one less than gtk_text_tag_table_get_size(). Each tag in a table has a "
"unique priority; setting the priority of one tag shifts the priorities of "
"all the other tags in the table to maintain a unique priority for each tag. "
"Higher priority tags \"win\" if two tags both set the same text attribute. "
"When adding a tag to a tag table, it will be assigned the highest priority "
"in the table by default; so normally the precedence of a set of tags is the "
"order in which they were added to the table, or created with "
"gtk_text_buffer_create_tag(), which adds the tag to the buffer's table "
"automatically."
