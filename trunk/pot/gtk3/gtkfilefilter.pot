"#GtkFileChooser. Files can be filtered based on their name (with "

"Filtering by mime types handles aliasing and subclassing of mime types; e.g. "
"a filter for text/plain also matches a file with mime type application/rtf, "
"since application/rtf is a subclass of text/plain. Note that #GtkFileFilter "
"allows wildcards for the subtype of a mime type, so you can e.g. filter for "
