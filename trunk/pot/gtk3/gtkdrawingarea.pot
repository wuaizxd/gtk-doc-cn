"Draw signals are normally delivered when a drawing area first comes "
"onscreen, or when it's covered by another window and then uncovered. You can "
"also force an expose event by adding to the \"damage region\" of the drawing "
"area's window; gtk_widget_queue_draw_area() and gdk_window_invalidate_rect() "
"are equally good ways to do this. You'll then get a draw signal for the "
"invalid region."

"To receive mouse events on a drawing area, you will need to enable them with "
"gtk_widget_add_events(). To receive keyboard events, you will need to set "
"the \"can-focus\" property on the drawing area, and you should probably draw "
"some user-visible indication that the drawing area is focused. Use "
"gtk_widget_has_focus() in your expose event handler to decide whether to "
"draw the focus indicator. See gtk_render_focus() for one way to draw focus."
