"Converts a string into canonical form, standardizing such issues as whether "
"a character with an accent is represented as a base character and combining "
"accent or as a single precomposed character. The string has to be valid "
"UTF-8, otherwise %NULL is returned. You should generally call "
"g_utf8_normalize() before comparing two Unicode strings."

"The normalization mode %G_NORMALIZE_DEFAULT only standardizes differences "
"that do not affect the text content, such as the above-mentioned accent "
"representation. %G_NORMALIZE_ALL also standardizes the \"compatibility\" "
"characters in Unicode, such as SUPERSCRIPT THREE to the standard forms (in "
"this case DIGIT THREE). Formatting information may be lost but for most text "
"operations such characters should be considered the same."

"%G_NORMALIZE_DEFAULT_COMPOSE and %G_NORMALIZE_ALL_COMPOSE are like "
"%G_NORMALIZE_DEFAULT and %G_NORMALIZE_ALL, but returned a result with "
"composed forms rather than a maximally decomposed form. This is often useful "
"if you intend to convert the string to a legacy encoding or pass it to a "
"system with less capable Unicode handling."
